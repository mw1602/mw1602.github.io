I'm a [psychologist at New York University](http://www.psych.nyu.edu/pylkkanen/lab/mashawesterlund.html), studying how language is processed in the brain. I did an undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science at McGill University, in Montreal, and I'm now in the fifth (and last!) year of my PhD in Cognition and Perception at NYU. 

I will defend the superiority of Montreal bagels over New York bagels to the bitter end.
